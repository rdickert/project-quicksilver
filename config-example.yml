# IMPORTANT: Read this, then delete.
# Minimal configuration: You need to at least set passwords.
# There are passwords for: (1) webmaster(linux), (2) developers(linux), (3) users (linux)
# (4)db root (mariadb). You must also set db username/password for each site to deploy
# You can copy this file with no changes to try a local deployment (it will install the Panopoly
# distro on VirtualBox)

# Server Configuration
#######################

server_hostname: 'myserver'

# In the US, this timezone setter only works with America/[cityname] 
#DON'T USE: US/Pacific US/Mountain US/Central US/Eastern etc.
# This list may help: http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php
# or look at /usr/share/zoneinfo/
timezone: America/Denver
locale: en_US.UTF-8

# A note on passwords and key files: 
# Passwords must be hashed, not plaintext. The following directions work for
# generating a password hash in Ubuntu and will likely work for any Debian system.
# See source: http://serverfault.com/questions/330069/how-to-create-an-sha-512-hashed-password-for-shadow/479036#479036
# * Run `sudo apt-get install whois`. This will add the `mkpasswd` command
# * Run `mkpasswd -m sha-512 MyPAsSwOrD $(openssl rand -base64 16 | tr -d '+=' | head -c 16)`
#   (substitude your desired password for MyPAsSwOrD above)
# * Copy and paste the output into the password field for the user.
# (Instructions for OSX and Windows would be helpful - please contribute!)
#
# Leaving the password blank does not seem to allow a non-password protected
# account to be logged-in via SSH or su, but I don't know for a fact that the accounts
# are safe. Please report security issues!
#
# ssh_key_file should be a path to a .pub file and will allow users to log in
# via ssh without a password.

# Use this for deploying drush archives (created with the `drush archive-dump` command)
# When the script completes, your site should be up and running

# Set to [] to skip. Add more sites as shown below (works for profiles, too)

#   - name: site-main

# Use this to deploy new empty Drupal websites. If you set drush_site_install to true,
# Drush will attempt to deploy the distro with reasonable defaults. If you want to control
# the installation, set this to False and your website will start at its install.php script
# In this case, you will need the database credentials listed below (the database will be 
# provisioned for you). 
#
# Use the distro/profile specify the version of Drupal you want. See http://drupal.org/project/distributions
# See Some typical choices:
#   Basic Drupal: drupal/standard
#   Panopoly (very nice starter site - try this if you're new to Drupal): panopoly/panopoly
#   Commerce Kickstart: commerce_kickstart/commerce_kickstart
#   Open Enterprise: openenterprise/openenterprise
